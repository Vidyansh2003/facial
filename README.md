Facial Recognition Attendance System

üìå Overview

A contactless attendance system that uses advanced facial recognition techniques to accurately identify individuals even in low-light environments. Designed for classrooms, offices, and workplaces where traditional methods are inefficient or require human contact.

üöÄ Motivation


Traditional attendance tracking is slow and prone to errors.
Post-COVID, demand for contactless solutions has surged.
Many existing systems fail in low-light conditions.

Multiple Person Detection ‚Äì Successfully detects and labels multiple faces in the frame.

Liveness Detection ‚Äì Accurately flags spoof attempts when a photo is shown to the camera (‚Äúspoof‚Äù label in red).

Low-light Performance ‚Äì Detects and recognizes faces in dim lighting conditions.

Conclusion

Noisy Image Handling ‚Äì Works in environments with high visual noise or grainy images.The Facial Recognition Attendance System with Liveness Detection solution is a frictionless and efficient way to manage attendance. With the help of MobileNetV2 for liveness detection and the face_recognition library for identity validation, real-time tracking is made possible without the possibility of spoofing. Although modest low light can also occur, extremely advanced preprocessing techniques increase the system's performance reliability in a variety of probable situations. This system is more effective than traditional techniques for documenting attendance, and it is ideal for workplaces or institutions. It also has the potential to be improved and expanded in terms of accuracy and scalability.
