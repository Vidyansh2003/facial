Facial Recognition Attendance System

📌 Overview

A contactless attendance system that uses advanced facial recognition techniques to accurately identify individuals even in low-light environments. Designed for classrooms, offices, and workplaces where traditional methods are inefficient or require human contact.

🚀 Motivation


Traditional attendance tracking is slow and prone to errors.
Post-COVID, demand for contactless solutions has surged.
Many existing systems fail in low-light conditions.

Multiple Person Detection – Successfully detects and labels multiple faces in the frame.

Liveness Detection – Accurately flags spoof attempts when a photo is shown to the camera (“spoof” label in red).

Low-light Performance – Detects and recognizes faces in dim lighting conditions.

Noisy Image Handling – Works in environments with high visual noise or grainy images.
